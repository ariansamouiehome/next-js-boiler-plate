                description="Growing up we all learn what aspect of ourselves is acceptable and what is not. This is due to the social control technique of good behaviour equals reward, whilst bad behaviour equals punishment and rejection. This social control technique is something that has existed since the 1600's which every previous line of our family has gone through and been a victim of. <br/><br/> The aspects of us that have been seen as unacceptable were rejected by our caregivers. As a child being dependent on our social circle for survival, we learnt to push away those aspects of ourselves that were deemed not acceptable, whilst simultaneously exaggerating the aspects of us that are approved of by our caregivers. <br /> <br />Being completely dependant on our caregivers for survival, this behaviour became our coping mechanism. This coping mechanism becomes our default way of being that we take into adulthood. By this point our behaviour of rejecting the aspects of ourselves that is deemed not acceptable has become so ingrained in us, that we no longer have a real concept of our most authentic self anymore.<br /> <br />The way we heal from this is to find those aspects of ourselves that we denied, rejected and disowned from our subconscious and bring them to the light of our consciousness. We do this with having unconditional love for those parts and opening up so that we can finally hear what they have to say. <br /> <br /> To learn more about shadow work, get in touch."

We tend to define trauma only when itâ€™s the most extreme stuff a person has experienced. Such as mental or sexual abuse, human trafficking or death in the family. Every single human has trauma. This means everyone has fragmentation within their being.<br /><br /> As humans the way we cope with trauma is that we dissociate. Every time we experience trauma (distress without resolve), your consciousness splits into parts. Depending on what feelings are associated with that trauma at the time, the way we cope is by burying those feelings deep in our subconscious when the split occurs.<br /><br /> In order to heal we must reintegrate those fragments into our being. To learn more about Fragmentation, get in touch and book a call."
